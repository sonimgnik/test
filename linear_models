# Step 1: Load the Data
require(RCurl)
require(gdata)

# Read data into R
url<- "http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/mlr/excel/mlr01.xls"
data.temp <- read.xls(url)

#----------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2: Save the data and create data frame

#Save to local file
write.csv(data.temp, file = "Data.csv")

#Load data from csv and crate data frame
df <- read.csv("Homework8_Data.csv")
df <- subset(df, select = -c(X))


#clean environments
rm(data.temp)

#rename columns in data frame
colnames(df) <- c("fawn", "adultPop", "annualPrecip", "badWinter")

#----------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 3: Inspect the file

#Inspect the data to ensure 8 observations of 4 variables
str(df)

##Notes:
# adj R-squared how well the model is fitting the actual data
#Residual Standard Error: Residual Standard Error is measure of the quality of a linear regression fit
#The coefficient t-value is a measure of how many standard deviations our coefficient estimate is far away from 0
#Residuals are essentially the difference between the actual observed response values
#F-statistic is a good indicator of whether there is a relationship between our predictor and the response variables

#----------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 2: Load the Data

#Create bivariate plots of number of baby fawns versus adult antelope population, 
#the precipitation that year, and the severity of the winter.

#plot1: fawn vs adultPop
independent <- df$adultPop
dependent <- df$fawn
x <- independent
y <- dependent
plot1 <- data.frame(x, y)
plot( x, y, main = "Bivariate Analysis:Fawn Pop vs. Adult Pop", xlab = "Adult Pop", ylab = "Fawns", col="blue")

#plot2: fawn vs. precip
independent <- df$annualPrecip
dependent <- df$fawn
x <- independent
y <- dependent
plot2 <- data.frame(x, y)
plot( x, y, main = "Bivariate Analysis: Fawn Pop vs. Annual Precip", xlab = "Annual Precip", ylab = "Fawns", col="blue")

#plot3: fawn vs winter
independent <- df$badWinter
dependent <- df$fawn
x <- independent
y <- dependent
plot3 <- data.frame(x, y)
plot( x, y, main = "Bivariate Analysis: Fawn Pop vs. Winter Severity ", xlab = "badWinter", ylab = "Fawns", col="blue")

#----------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5: Create three regression models

library(ggplot2)

# Model 1: predict the number of fawns from the severity of the winter
m1 <- lm(fawn ~ badWinter, data = df)

summary(m1)
abline(m1)

#Create regression plot
g <- ggplot(df, aes(x = badWinter, y = fawn)) + geom_point()
g
g + stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "blue")

predict(m1)

# Model 2: predict the number of fawns from two variables 
m2 <- lm(formula = fawn ~ badWinter, data = df)
summary(m2)

plot(df$badWinter, df$fawn)
abline(m2)

m2 = lm(formula = fawn ~ annualPrecip, data = df)
summary(m2)

m2 <- lm(formula = fawn ~ badWinter + annualPrecip, data = df)
summary(m2)

# Model 3: predict the number of fawns from the three other variables.

#Take ALL variables into account
m3 <- lm(fawn ~ ., data = df)
m3

#This is the same as writing the abbreviated code above
m3 <- lm(fawn ~ badWinter + annualPrecip + adultPop, data = df)
m3
summary(m3)

#Drop annualPrecip and just use adultPop for a better result
m3 <- lm(fawn ~ badWinter + adultPop, data = df)
summary(m3)

#make a prediction based on models

b = badWinter = 5
c = adultPop = 2.5

newdata <- data.frame(b,c)
predict(m3, newdata, type = "response")

sum.model <- summary(m3)
sum.model$adj.r.squared

g <- ggplot(df, aes(x = badWinter, y = adultPop)) + geom_point(aes(size = fawn, color = fawn))
g
g + stat_smooth(method = "lm")

#----------------------------------------------------------------
# Analysis
# 1. Which model works best? 

cat("Based on the return from m3 <- lm(fawn ~ ., data = df), annual precip is the  
least significant factor for prediction in this model.  Adult population and  
winter severity have the most impact on the population of fawns \n")

#2. Which of the predictors are statistically significant in each model? 

cat("All variables have significance.  Hwoever, aultPop has the greatest 
signifiance with 0.0112.  badWinter has the second greatest signifance.  
The model improve for prediction purposes if you remove annual precipitation.")

#3. If you wanted to create the most parsimonious model (i.e., the one that did 
#the best job with the fewest predictors), what would it contain?

cat("The model improve for prediction purposes if you remove annual precipitation.
You can include adultPop and badWinter.")
